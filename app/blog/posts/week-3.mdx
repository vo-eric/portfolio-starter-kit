I feel like there is an overreliance on using JavaScript to get things done on the frontend, especially when it comes to
applying certain styles to elements. To illustrate my point here's an example from the project I worked on this week. The
idea was to have sections that would expand and collapse when clicked upon. Initially, I had something like:

```

[selectedStyle, setSelectedStyle] = useState<string | undefined>()

.
.
.

<div
  key={style.style}
  onClick={() => setSelectedStyle(style.style)}
  className={`selectedStyle === style.style ? "expanded" : "collapsed`}
  >
  <p>{style.style}</p>
  <p>
    ...some details
  </p>
</div>

```

I don't think I'm alone in taking this approach and this would be totally fine!

But do we NEED to do it this way?

When implementing this I remembered there was a HTML element that had similar functionality.
After firing a quick question to ChatGPT I was reminded that it was the `<details>` element.
Unsure about whether the expansion/collapse could be animated, I went to the almighty Google
and was presented with a video by Kevin Powell (my CSS GOAT). Turns out that not only could
we transition the expansion/collapse, we could do it purely in CSS! Here's the relevant CSS
that does this:

```

:root {
  interpolate-size: allow-keywords;
}

details {
  overflow: hidden;
}

details::details-content {
  display: block;
  block-size: 0;
  transition-property: block-size 0.3s ease-in-out;
  transition-duration: 0.3s;
  transition-behavior: allow-discrete;
}

details[open]::details-content {
  block-size: auto;
  block-size: calc-size(auto, size);
}

```

According to MDN, `interpolate-size` enables animations and transitions between a length-percentage value
and an intrinsic size value such as auto, fit-content, or max-content. This is where the magic happens.
We hide the overflow so the "collapsed" text doesn't show. To select the text in the details element we use
the `::details-content` psuedo element. Thanks to `interpolate-size` we can transition on the content's block
size and we add `transition-behavior: allow-discrete` to allow the transition to also apply on the collapse.
If you want to get fancier and only have one detail expanded at once add `name=...` to the details element.
Voila!

Note that most of this styling isn't widely adopted. At the moment Firefox does not support most of these features,
but that's okay as a lot of this styling is suited for progressive enhancement. Until then, the details will pop in and out
instantly.
